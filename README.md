## ðŸ§ª How to Run (Local Test)

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] pydantic requests customtkinter
python3 traffic_log_api.py
python3 relay_proxy_server.py
python3 vpn_gui_client.py
```

Then set system proxy (macOS example):

```bash
sudo networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 9001
sudo networksetup -setsecurewebproxy Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 9001
```

Go to [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) to check IP.
